            <h2>Advantages of travelling</h2>
            <h4>
                Firstly, one of the most critical advantages that travelling is offering you is the fact that it improves your health. When you are travelling, you get the chance to become truly free from your life routine, and because of that, your stress level is going down, lowering your chances of developing heart disease. It also helps you boost your confidence and your well-being mood and also enables you to move over hard times that appear in your life.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                Secondly, travelling makes you smarter. It makes you more present and more connected with the real world, becoming more curious about what’s going on around you. For example, if you are travelling in a foreign country, for sure you will become curious about the lifestyle, specifics, people and daily habits of that place. You will also get out of your comfort zone, and you will start socialising more with people around you. Also, travelling offers you a great opportunity of learning new languages and new life perspectives, and you can use yourself in the future.

            <h4>
                For most people, it is tough to leave their comfort zone, but when they are doing it, they will see that it represents the place where they learn the most. Firstly, when you are thinking about travelling, it sounds scary, and many people don’t do it only because of that.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                Another essential thing to take into consideration while travelling is the expansion of your social network. While travelling, you have the excellent opportunity to meet new people, from different cultures, and you will see the things you have and have not in common. You will see that talking with other people and being curious about their cultures, you get to know them better and even to create a long-lasting relationship with them. The most significant advantage of knowing foreign people is the fact that you are becoming more aware of other cultures, and you will start seeing life from another perspective, helping you overcome, daily problems efficiently.

            <h4>
                Travelling around the world makes you more attractive as a person. Having different stories to tell your friends and people you know will make yourself image better, making you a fascinating person to know.
